## Introduction
* Former researches:
    1. arbitrarily orientated wave vector [7-11]
    2. kinetic treatment [13-15]
    3. magnetized case ($$\parallel$$ & $$\perp$$) [16-18]
    4. temperatures ($$\parallel$$ & $$\perp$$) [19]
* Author's arguements:
    > Fluid equations yield the same first order temperature corrections as the kinetic theory for oblique modes ... 
    > The fluid approximation is thus definitely a tool of paramount importance to deal with beam plasma instabilities.
    > Nevertheless, even the fluid tensor can be analytically involved when considering ...
* *Mathematica notebook* -- the symbolic calculation of the fluid tensor
